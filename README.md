### Glad to see you here! 

I'm aspiring developer with entry-level professional experience in the apps development. My ambition is to help my team increase productivity 
and improve my knowledge about apps development. I have a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Software engineering, and have also attended courses in mobile 
and web development. 

In the past, as part of my internship I have worked in a company for six months. I worked on projects using Wordpress, HTML, CSS, 
JavaScript and SEO Tools technologies. In my thesis I worked on a project where I created a mobile application for reading e-books. 
I used React Native, Firebase, API and JSON.

I'm thrilled about opportunities and challenges that allow me to utilize my proficiency with React Native and leverage 
my existing learnigs in mobile development.
